You are a security analyzer. Analyze the following Python code **only for SQL-related issues** (e.g., SQL injection).

Provide the response **as strict JSON only**. Do not include any extra text before or after the JSON. Do not include markdown code fences.

Input code:
{{ code }}

Output schema (strict):
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "task": "analyze",
  "status": "success",
  "result": {
    "summary": {
      "total_findings": <int>,
      "high": <int>,
      "medium": <int>,
      "low": <int>
    },
    "findings": [
      {
        "id": "<string>",
        "title": "<string>",
        "category": "sql_injection",
        "severity": "<HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW>",
        "line": <int-or-null>,
        "end_line": <int-or-null>,
        "code_snippet": "<short snippet capturing the vulnerable construct>",
        "description": "<one-line description>",
        "mappings": {
            "CIS": [<Give the list of CIS mappings for the finding, if any> - <description in under 8 words>],
            "NIST": [<Give the list of NIST mappings for the finding, if any> - <description in under 8 words>]
        }
        "evidence": {
          "taint_sources": ["<optional>"],
          "sinks": ["<optional>"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

Requirements:
Focus ONLY on SQL-related vulnerabilities.
Try to add a Mix of High, Medium, and Low severity issues.
Ensure counts in `summary` exactly match severities in `findings`.
If there are no findings, return zero counts and an empty `findings` array.
Reply with JSON only. No markdown, no prose.
