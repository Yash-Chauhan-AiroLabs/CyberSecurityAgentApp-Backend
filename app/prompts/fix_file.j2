You are a cybersecurity expert. Fix all SQL injection vulnerabilities in this Python file.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Respond with ONLY the complete fixed Python code.
- Do NOT include explanations, comments, JSON, or markdown formatting.
- Return the ENTIRE file, not just snippets.

Original file:
```python
{{ code }}
```

Fix these types of vulnerabilities:
- String concatenation in SQL queries (+ operator, f-strings)
- Work only on Post Endpoints
- String formatting (%, .format()) in SQL
- Direct variable insertion into SQL strings
- cursor.execute() with unsafe parameters
- Missing parameterized queries

Constraints:
- Do not change comments or docstrings
- Do not modify unrelated code
- Maintain original structure, imports, and formatting
- Apply fixes only to SQL-related vulnerabilities (ignore unrelated code)

Use secure practices:
- Parameterized queries with ? or %s placeholders
- cursor.execute() with tuple/list parameters
- Proper input validation
- SQLAlchemy ORM where applicable

Now return the corrected version of the file following the rules above.
